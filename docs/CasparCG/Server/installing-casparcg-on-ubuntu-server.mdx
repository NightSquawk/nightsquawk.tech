In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing CasparCG on an Ubuntu Server. CasparCG is a powerful open-source broadcast graphics and video playout server that’s widely used in professional broadcasting environments.

<!--truncate-->

## Prerequisites

Before installing CasparCG, make sure your Ubuntu Server is up to date. You will also need administrative privileges to install the required software.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Installing Dependencies

CasparCG requires several dependencies to function correctly. Install the following packages using the apt package manager:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git libssl-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libasound2-dev libx11-dev
```

## Downloading and Building CasparCG

To install CasparCG, you’ll need to clone the official CasparCG Server repository and build it from source.

1. ### Clone the CasparCG Server repository

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/CasparCG/server.git
 cd server
    ```

2. ### Build CasparCG

You can now build CasparCG using the provided scripts.

 ```bash
 cmake .
 make
    ```

This process might take a while depending on your server’s performance.

3. ### Running CasparCG

After the build process is complete, you can start CasparCG using the following command:

 ```bash
 ./casparcg
    ```

CasparCG will start, and you should see output indicating that it’s running. By default, CasparCG listens on port `5250` for commands and on port `8000` for the web-based interface.

## Configuring CasparCG

Once CasparCG is installed and running, you may need to configure it to suit your specific needs. The configuration file `casparcg.config` is located in the root directory of your CasparCG installation.

1. ### Editing the Configuration File

Use your preferred text editor to modify the configuration file:

 ```bash
 nano casparcg.config
    ```

You can adjust various settings such as video modes, channels, and logging options.

Make sure to back up your configuration file before making changes.

## Starting CasparCG on Boot

To ensure CasparCG starts automatically when your server reboots, you can create a systemd service.

1. ### Create a systemd service file

 ```bash
 sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/casparcg.service
    ```

2. ### Add the following configuration

 ```ini
 [Unit]
 Description=CasparCG Server
 After=network.target

 [Service]
 ExecStart=/path/to/casparcg
 Restart=always
 User=youruser
 Group=yourgroup
 Environment=DISPLAY=:0

 [Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

Replace `/path/to/casparcg` with the path to your CasparCG executable, and `youruser` and `yourgroup` with your actual username and group.

3. ### Enable the Service

 ```bash
 sudo systemctl enable casparcg
 sudo systemctl start casparcg
    ```

CasparCG will now start automatically with your server.

## Testing Your Installation

You can verify that CasparCG is running correctly by connecting to its command interface using Telnet:

```bash
telnet localhost 5250
```

You should see a response from CasparCG, indicating that it is ready to accept commands.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed CasparCG on your Ubuntu Server. CasparCG is now ready to be used for broadcast graphics and video playout in your production environment. Be sure to consult the official CasparCG documentation for more advanced configurations and usage tips.
