In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Syncthing on Windows. Syncthing is a free and open-source file synchronization tool that syncs files between devices directly, ensuring your files remain private and secure.

## Prerequisites

Before you install Syncthing, make sure your Windows operating system is up to date. You should also have administrative privileges to install software.

## Step 1: Download Syncthing

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [Syncthing Downloads page](https://syncthing.net/downloads/).
2. Under the **Base Syncthing** section, find the **Windows** options and choose the **Intel/AMD (64-bit)** build for most systems.
3. Download the installer file (`syncthing-windows-amd64-v1.x.x.exe`).

## Step 2: Install Syncthing

1. After downloading, locate the installer file in your **Downloads** folder and double-click it to start the installation.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts, choosing the default installation path unless you prefer a different location.
3. After installation, you can opt to launch Syncthing immediately or manually start it later.

## Step 3: Running Syncthing

1. If Syncthing didn’t launch automatically after installation, search for **Syncthing** in the Start menu and click to open it.
2. Syncthing will open a web interface in your default browser, which serves as the main control panel.

## Step 4: Configure Syncthing

1. On the Syncthing Web UI, you’ll see your device ID, which is used for connecting other devices.
2. Click on **Add Folder** to sync a folder. Specify the folder path, folder ID, and optional advanced settings.
3. To connect another device, click **Add Remote Device** and enter the other device's Syncthing ID.

## Step 5: Optional Integration

1. Go to the **Actions** menu in the top-right corner and choose **Settings**.
2. In the **GUI** section, enable **Start Syncthing on login** and **Minimize to tray** for better Windows integration.

## Step 6: Firewall Configuration

When prompted by Windows Firewall, allow Syncthing to communicate on both private and public networks to ensure proper syncing functionality.

## Step 7: Testing Syncthing

To verify that Syncthing is working, check the status in the Web UI. You should see a "Syncing" status for any folders you have added, and the connected devices will be listed.

## Conclusion

Syncthing is now installed and configured on your Windows system. With its secure, peer-to-peer file syncing, you can easily synchronize data across your devices. For advanced features or troubleshooting, check out the [Syncthing documentation](https://docs.syncthing.net/).
